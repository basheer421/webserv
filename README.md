# Quick to run web server
 Event-driven Asynchronous Web server with CGI support and simple configuration setup that allows for multiple servers. 

## Not maintained!

 This project was made with nginx web server as a big inspiration and with help of the contributers.

 A sample configuration file was provided with comments to show the usage.

 To compile and run:

 `make`

 `./webserv [conf_file]`


 Eg. (default conf is "conf.ini"):

 `make && make clean`

 `./webserv`
